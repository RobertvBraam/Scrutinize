In addition to forward migration support, FluentMigrator also supports different ways to execute the migrations along with selective migrations called profiles and executing arbitrary SQL.","LicenseUrl":"https://github.com/fluentmigrator/fluentmigrator/blob/master/LICENSE.txt","LicenseType":"","Repository":{"Type":"git","Url":"https://github.com/fluentmigrator/fluentmigrator.git","Commit":""}},{"PackageName":"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer","PackageVersion":"7.0.5","PackageUrl":"https://asp.net/","Copyright":"© Microsoft Corporation.
